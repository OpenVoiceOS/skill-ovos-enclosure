    - name: Smart speaker functionality
      fields:
        - type: label
          label: <p>You can enable or disable smart speaker services and functionality currently present on the MycroftOS system. As every user has different requirements and is using different hardware, devices and network protocols, all these services are disabled by default. You can easily enable or disable any of the below services here, by selecting the enabled checkbox (slightly delayed as you need to wait for settings synchronisation). If you only want to start the service now without enabling them, you can also use your voice command to your MycroftOS device (For example  Hey Mycroft, start spotify).</p>
